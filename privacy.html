        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> February 2026</p>

        <h3>Our Commitment</h3>
        <p>Fidel Family is designed for toddlers and young children. We take their privacy extremely seriously. Our policy is simple: <strong>we collect zero data</strong>.</p>

        <h3>Information We Collect</h3>
        <p><strong>None.</strong> Fidel Family does not collect, store, transmit, or share any personal information whatsoever. This includes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>No personal data (name, email, age, etc.)</li>
          <li>No usage analytics or behavioral tracking</li>
          <li>No device identifiers or fingerprinting</li>
          <li>No location data</li>
          <li>No photos, camera, or microphone access</li>
          <li>No cookies or web tracking</li>
          <li>No advertising or ad identifiers</li>
          <li>No third-party SDKs that collect data</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Local Storage Only</h3>
        <p>All learning progress, preferences, and settings are stored locally on your device. This data never leaves your device and is not accessible to us or any third party. If you delete the app, this data is deleted with it.</p>

        <h3>No Network Requests</h3>
        <p>Fidel Family is designed to work entirely offline. The app does not make network requests to external servers. All content (images, audio, text) is bundled with the app at download time.</p>

        <h3>Children's Privacy (COPPA Compliance)</h3>
        <p>Fidel Family is designed for children ages 1&ndash;5. We comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and similar international regulations:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>We do not collect personal information from children (or anyone)</li>
          <li>We do not require account creation</li>
          <li>We do not include social features, chat, or user-generated content</li>
          <li>We do not display advertisements</li>
          <li>We do not include links to external websites or apps accessible to children</li>
          <li>There are no in-app purchases</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Third-Party Services</h3>
        <p>Fidel Family does not integrate with any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services. The only external services involved are the Apple App Store and Google Play Store, which are used solely for distributing the app and are governed by their own privacy policies.</p>

        <h3>Data Security</h3>
        <p>Since we collect no data, there is no data to secure, breach, or lose. Your child's learning happens entirely on your device.</p>

        <h3>Changes to This Policy</h3>
        <p>If we ever change this privacy policy, we will update this page and the "Last updated" date above. We will never introduce data collection without providing clear notice and obtaining appropriate consent.</p>
